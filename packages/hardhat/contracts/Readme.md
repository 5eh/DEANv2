This is the open sourced (APACHE License 2.0) contract directory for ARTHUR LABS, created and hosted for the Movement Labs x Henry Hackathon, on June 3rd to July 11th. 

This directory hosts the 3 smart contracts necesssary to build a legally binding, customer encrypted data and bilateral promise of delivery contract to handle commerce in blockchain.

This is a start to hopefully a wonderful business that can help onboard some people into Web3, or just simply let nerds exchange commerce on blockchains!

  <summary>Read the Backstory</summary>
  Watson started building ARTHUR LABS through the University of Texas accelerator program. 
  He was fascinated in developing this concept out further, and the first biggest tackle was to making legally inforcable smart contracts for his Digital Marketplace Factory.
  Watson decided to bring this into the hack and explore the MEVM Blockchain, although very difficult to deploy and test, he is still building out the architecture nonetheless.
